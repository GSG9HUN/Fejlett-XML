Its purpose is two-fold: to assist developers in designing authoring tools that produce accessible Web content and to assist developers in creating an accessible authoring interface. Authoring tools can enable, encourage, and assist users (\"authors\") in the creation of accessible Web content through prompts, alerts, checking and repair functions, help files and automated tools. It is just as important that all people be able to author content as it is for all people to have access to it. The tools used to create this information must therefore be accessible themselves. Adoption of these guidelines will contribute to the proliferation of Web content that can be read by a broader range of readers and authoring tools that can be used by a broader range of authors.

    "description": "These guidelines explain how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities. The guidelines are intended for all Web content developers (page authors and site designers) and for developers of authoring tools. The primary goal of these guidelines is to promote accessibility. However, following them will also make Web content more available to \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e users, whatever user agent they are using (e.g., desktop browser, voice browser, mobile phone, automobile-based personal computer, etc.) or constraints they may be operating under (e.g., noisy surroundings, under- or over-illuminated rooms, in a hands-free environment, etc.). Following these guidelines will also help people find information on the Web more quickly. These guidelines do not discourage content developers from using images, video, etc., but rather explain how to make multimedia content more accessible to a wide audience. This is a reference document for accessibility principles and design ideas. Some of the strategies discussed in this document address certain Web internationalization and mobile access concerns. However, this document focuses on accessibility and does not fully address the related concerns of other \u003cabbr\u003eW3C\u003c/abbr\u003e Activities. Please consult the W3C Mobile Access Activity home page and the W3C Internationalization Activity home page for more information. This document is meant to be stable and therefore does not provide specific information about browser support for different technologies as that information changes rapidly. Instead, the Web Accessibility Initiative (\u003cabbr\u003eWAI\u003c/abbr\u003e) Web site provides such information (refer to [WAI-UA-SUPPORT]). This document includes an appendix that organizes all of the checkpoints by topic and priority. The checkpoints in the appendix link to their definitions in the current document. The topics identified in the appendix include images, multimedia, tables, frames, forms, and scripts. The appendix is available as either a tabular summary of checkpoints or as a simple list of checkpoints. A separate document, entitled \"Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\" ([TECHNIQUES]), explains how to implement the checkpoints defined in the current document. The Techniques Document discusses each checkpoint in more detail and provides examples using the Hypertext Markup Language (\u003cabbr\u003eHTML\u003c/abbr\u003e), Cascading Style Sheets (\u003cabbr\u003eCSS\u003c/abbr\u003e), Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (\u003cabbr\u003eSMIL\u003c/abbr\u003e), and the Mathematical Markup Language (\u003cabbr\u003eMathML\u003c/abbr\u003e). The Techniques Document also includes techniques for document validation and testing, and an index of HTML elements and attributes (and which techniques use them). The Techniques Document has been designed to track changes in technology and is expected to be updated more frequently than the current document. \u003cstrong\u003eNote.\u003c/strong\u003e Not all browsers or multimedia tools may support the features described in the guidelines. In particular, new features of HTML 4.0 or CSS 1 or CSS 2 may not be supported. \"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\" is part of a series of accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative. The series also includes User Agent Accessibility Guidelines ([WAI-USERAGENT]) and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines ([WAI-AUTOOLS]).",

    "description": "A variety of mobile information appliances are developed rapidly such as smart phones with capability of Internet access, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), and car navigation systems. A navigation service is one of the indispensable services to these mobile information appliances, but currently it is only available with car navigation systems. In order to use the navigation service not only on cars but also on trains, on buses, and on foot with various mobile information appliances, a common data format for describing navigation information such as locations of points and route information is required. The \"NVML\" (NaVigation Markup Language) is a markup language for describing the navigation information satisfying the above requirement. The NVML enables us to use a navigation service at any time and anywhere, and it will also be used in other services such as a guide service for sightseeing, a travel planning service, and a publishing service for tourists.",

CSS1 is a simple style sheet mechanism that allows authors and readers to attach style (e.g. fonts, colors and spacing) to HTML documents. The CSS1 language is human readable and writable, and expresses style in common desktop publishing terminology.One of the fundamental features of CSS is that style sheets cascade; authors can attach a preferred style sheet, while the readermay have a personal style sheet to adjust for human or technological handicaps. The rules for resolving conflicts between different style sheets are defined in this specification.",

This document describes extensions to the selectors defined in CSS level 2. These extended selectors will be used by CSS level 3. Selectors define the following function: \u003cpre xml:space\u003d\"preserve\"\u003e expression ∗ element → boolean \u003c/pre\u003e That is, given an element and a selector, this specification defines whether that element matches the selector. These expressions can also be used, for instance, to select a set of elements, or a single element from a set of elements, by evaluating the expression across all the elements in a subtree. \u003cacronym\u003eSTTS\u003c/acronym\u003e (Simple Tree Transformation Sheets), a language for transforming XML trees, uses this mechanism.

MathML is an XML application for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text. This specification of the markup language MathML is intended primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input or output. It is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e a User\u0027s Guide but rather a reference document. This document begins with background information on mathematical notation, the problems it poses, and the philosophy underlying the solutions MathML 2.0 proposes. MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content. About thirty of the MathML tags describe abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and fifty provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of MathML characters and their relation to fonts. While MathML is human-readable, it is anticipated that, in all but the simplest cases, authors will use equation editors, conversion programs, and other specialized software tools to generate MathML. Several versions of such MathML tools already exist, and a number of others, both freely available software and commercial products, are under development.",

Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general.  WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. \u003cspan\u003eSee Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.\u003c/span\u003e   \u003cspan\u003eWCAG 2.0 succeeds Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10], which was published as a W3C Recommendation May 1999.

These descriptions must be in addition to the human-readable versions of that information.

In some situations it is appropriate to transfer the user from one voice browser to another. In other situations, the user may start from a visual web page and then transfer to a voice browser, yet another possibility is transfer from a voice browser to a human operator. This document describes the requirements for how voice browsers and other call sites can cooperate by sharing data to create a seamless caller experience. An example of a potential resulting benefit to a caller is not having to re-enter the same information repeatedly at different call sites. A potential benefit for service providers is a flexible architecture for deploying and interconnecting disparate call sites.",

While the traditional CAPTCHA approach of asking the user to identify obscured text in an image remains common, other mechanisms are gaining in prominence. These approaches generally require users to perform a task believed to be possible for humans and difficult for robots, but the nature of the task inherently excludes many people with disabilities, resulting in an incorrect denial of service to these users. Research findings also indicate that many popular CAPTCHA techniques are no longer particularly effective or secure, so it is necessary to consider alternative approaches to block robots, yet ensure these approaches support access for people with disabilities. This document examines a number of potential solutions that allow systems to test for human users, and the extent to which these solutions adequately accommodate people with disabilities.",

This GRDDL specification introduces markup based on existing standards for declaring that an XML document includes data compatible with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and for linking to algorithms (typically represented in XSLT), for extracting this data from the document. The markup includes a namespace-qualified attribute for use in general-purpose XML documents and a profile-qualified link relationship for use in valid XHTML documents. The GRDDL mechanism also allows an XML namespace document (or XHTML profile document) to declare that every document associated with that namespace (or profile) includes gleanable data and for linking to an algorithm for gleaning the data. A corresponding GRDDL Use Case Working Draft provides motivating examples. A GRDDL Primer demonstrates the mechanism on XHTML documents which include widely-deployed dialects known as microformats. A GRDDL Test Cases document illustrates specific issues in this design and provides materials to aid in test-driven development of GRDDL-aware agents. ",

The Multimodal Interaction Framework separates multimodal systems into a set of functional units, including Input and Output components, an Interaction Mananger, Session Components, System and Environment, and Application Functions. In order for those functional components to interact with each other to form an application interpreter, the browser implementation must allow for communication and coordination between those components. This DOM interface identifies the DOM APIs used to communicate and coordinate at the browser implemention level. Multimodal browsers can be stand-alone or distributed systems.",

It is often convenient to put a class (e.g., ) as a property value (e.g., topic or book subject) when building an ontology. While OWL Full and RDF Schema do not put any restriction on using classes as property values, in OWL DL and OWL Lite most properties cannot have classes as their values. We illustrate the direct approach for representing classes as property values in OWL-Full and RDF Schema. We present various alternative mechanisms for representing the required information in OWL DL and OWL Lite. For each approach, we discuss various considerations that the users should keep in mind when choosing the best approach for their purposes. ",

However, in some cases, the natural and convenient way to represent certain concepts is to use relations to link an individual to more than just one individual or value. These relations are called \u003cem\u003en-ary relations\u003c/em\u003e. For example, we may want to represent properties of a relation, such as our certainty about it, severity or strength of a relation, relevance of a relation, and so on. Another example is representing relations among multiple individuals, such as a buyer, a seller, and an object that was bought when describing a purchase of a book. This document presents ontology patterns for representing n-ary relations in RDF and OWL and discusses what users must consider when choosing these patterns.",

As such, great progress has been made in the consistent use of models throughout this process. Modern software development tools with support for the UML and code generation as well as Model-Driven Architectures allow for developers to synchronize and verify technical implementation with user requirements using models. However, the reusability of domain models is often limited because they are, by definition, domain specific and only take into consideration abstractions needed to make possible a solution within the confines of their own individual problem space. But the Web is broader than that and provides a multidimensional solution space capable of referencing an almost limitless set of domains. While much of our software becomes increasingly embedded in the Web, our development processes do not fully exploit the potential of model reuse from the Web yet. This note therefore introduces Semantic Web languages such as RDF Schema and OWL, and shows how they can be used in tandem with mainstream object-oriented languages. We show that the Semantic Web can serve as a platform on which domain models can be created, shared and reused.",

    "description": "This Working Group Note presents measurement results of various high-performance XML interchange encoding formats and their associated processors, made by the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Working Group. The measurements have been conducted following the recommendations of the XML Binary Characterization (XBC) Working Group. In particular, this draft covers measurements of the properties of \"compactness\", \"processing efficiency\" and \"roundtrip support\", as defined by the XBC WG. We start by describing the context in which this analysis is being made, and the position of an efficient format in the landscape of high performance XML strategies. Then we describe the measured quantities in detail and the test framework in which they were made, and give a short description of each format. Finally, a summary of the results and the conclusions of the group are included. The full measurements and analysis are included in an appendix and supporting documents. As a result of the measurements described here, the working group selected Efficient XML ([EffXML]) to be the basis for the proposed encoding specification to be prepared as a candidate W3C Recommendation. Follow up work has centered around integrating some features from the other measured format technologies, particularly variations for both more efficient structural and value encodings. ",

    "description": "Web services provide a standards-based foundation for exchanging information between distributed software systems. The W3C Recommendation Web Services Description Language (WSDL) specifies a standard way to describe the interfaces of a Web Service at a syntactic level and how to invoke it. While the syntactic descriptions provide information about the structure of input and output messages of an interface and about how to invoke the service, semantics are needed to describe what a Web service actual does. These semantics, when expressed in formal languages, disambiguate the description of Web services interfaces, paving the way for automatic discovery, composition and integration of software components. WSDL does not explicitly provide mechanisms to specify the semantics of a Web service. Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL) defines mechanisms by which semantic annotations can be added to WSDL components. This usage guide is an accompanying document to SAWSDL specification. It presents examples illustrating how to associate semantic annotations with a Web service. These annotations could be used for classifying, discovering, matching, composing, and invoking Web services. Some of the examples illustrated in this document use RDF and OWL Web Ontology Language for representing ontologies. Some knowledge of RDF and OWL is useful for understanding this document, but not essential.",

SenseLab is a collection of relational (Oracle) databases for neuroscientific research. The conversion of these databases into RDF/OWL format is an important step towards realizing the benefits of Semantic Web in integrative neuroscience research. This document describes how we represented some of the SenseLab databases in Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL), and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these representations. Our OWL representation is based on the reuse and extension of existing standard OWL ontologies developed in the biomedical ontology communities. The purpose of this document is to share our implementation experience with the community.",

It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface. CSS 2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more influence for HTML\u0027s \"style\" attribute and a new calculation of the \u0027clip\u0027 property), and adds a few highly requested features which have already been widely implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a \"snapshot\" of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features that are implemented interoperably at the date of publication of the Recommendation.",

User agents include browsers and other types of software that retrieve and render Web content. A user agent that conforms to these guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user interface and through other internal facilities, including its ability to communicate with other technologies (especially assistive technologies). Furthermore, all users, not just users with disabilities, should find conforming user agents to be more usable. In addition to helping developers of browsers and media players, this document will also benefit developers of assistive technologies because it explains what types of information and control an assistive technology may expect from a conforming user agent. Technologies not addressed directly by this document (e.g., technologies for braille rendering) will be essential to ensuring Web access for some users with disabilities. The \"User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0\" (\u003cacronym\u003eUAAG\u003c/acronym\u003e 2.0) is part of a series of accessibility guidelines published by the \u003cacronym\u003eW3C\u003c/acronym\u003e Web Accessibility Initiative (\u003cacronym\u003eWAI\u003c/acronym\u003e).",

As an application of the Resource Description Framework (RDF), SKOS allows concepts to be composed and published on the World Wide Web, linked with data on the Web and integrated into other concept schemes. This document is a user guide for those who would like to represent their concept scheme using SKOS. In basic SKOS, conceptual resources (concepts) are identified with URIs, labelled with strings in one or more natural languages, documented with various types of note, semantically related to each other in informal hierarchies and association networks, and aggregated into concept schemes. In advanced SKOS, conceptual resources can be mapped across concept schemes and grouped into labelled or ordered collections. Relationships between concept labels can be specified. Finally, the SKOS vocabulary itself can be extended to suit the needs of particular communities of practice or combined with other modelling vocabularies. This document is a companion to the SKOS Reference, which gives the normative reference on SKOS.",

Many knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes and subject heading systems, share a similar structure, and are used in similar applications. SKOS captures much of this similarity and makes it explicit, to enable data and technology sharing across diverse applications. The SKOS data model provides a standard, low-cost migration path for porting existing knowledge organization systems to the Semantic Web. SKOS also provides a light weight, intuitive language for developing and sharing new knowledge organization systems. It may be used on its own, or in combination with formal knowledge representation languages such as the Web Ontology language (OWL). This document is the normative specification of the Simple Knowledge Organization System. It is intended for readers who are involved in the design and implementation of information systems, and who already have a good understanding of Semantic Web technology, especially RDF and OWL. For an informative guide to using SKOS, see the SKOS Primer. ",

The first part presents the major challenges today for both developing and accessing mobile services, potential ways to bridge them with existing tools, technologies and infrastructure, and potential research directions to follow to provide a more comprehensive resolution or solution. The second part focuses on presenting the major technologies and the major options existing today to deploy content and applications on mobile phones. For each of these technologies, the document presents a short analysis of the technology\u0027s potential and the requirements in terms of infrastructure, devices, targeted end-users, and costs associated with implementation and delivery.",

At its inception, the Web also introduced fragment identifiers (preceded by \u003ccode\u003e#\u003c/code\u003e) as a means of addressing specific locations in a document. As highly interactive applications get built using Web parts (HTML, CSS and JavaScript component resources that are themselves Web addressible, there is an increasing need for encoding interaction state as part of the URI. The Web is beginning to discover and codify design patterns based on fragment identifiers for many of these use cases.This draft finding is being prepared in response to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/group/track/issues/60\"\u003e TAG issue #60\u003c/a\u003e.

When this exercise is complete, this finding will conclude by ensuring that these design patterns are mutually compatible. If some of these usage patterns are identified as being in conflict, we will recommend best practices that help side-step such conflicts. We encourage the wider Web community to point us at emerging usage scenarios and design patterns so that we maximize our chances of arriving at a final finding that helps move forward the architecture of  the Web in a self-consistent manner.",

The Multimodal Interaction Working Group examined a range of different use cases for extensions and published a W3C Note on Use Cases for Possible Future EMMA Features. This Version 1.1 document describes a set of new features based on feedback from implementers.",

    "description": " Filter effects are a way of processing an element\u0027s rendering before it is displayed in the document. Typically, rendering an element via CSS or SVG can conceptually described as if the element, including its children, are drawn into a buffer (such as a raster image) and then that buffer is composited into the elements parent. Filters apply an effect before the compositing stage. Examples of such effects are blurring, changing color intensity and warping the image. Although originally designed for use in SVG, filter effects are a set a set of operations to apply on an image buffer and therefore can be applied to nearly any presentational environment, including CSS. They are triggered by a style instruction (the ‘filter’ property). This specification describes filters in a manner that allows them to be used in content styled by CSS, such as HTML and SVG. It also defines a CSS property value function that produces a CSS \u003cimage\u003e value. ",

SHACL groups these descriptions and constraints into \"shapes\", which specify conditions that apply at a given RDF node. Shapes provide a high-level vocabulary to identify predicates and their associated cardinalities, datatypes and other constraints. Additional constraints can be associated with shapes using SPARQL and similar extension languages. These extension languages can also be used to define new high-level vocabulary terms. SHACL shapes can be used to communicate information about data structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user interfaces. This document defines the SHACL language and its underlying semantics.",

It is not a User\u0027s Guide but rather a reference document.\r\nMathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content. About thirty-eight of the MathML tags describe abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and seventy provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of special characters used for mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode, and their relation to fonts. ",

    "description": "SPARQL is a query language and a protocol for data that is stored natively as RDF or viewed as RDF via middleware. The main mechanism for computing query results in SPARQL is subgraph matching: RDF triples in both the queried RDF data and the query pattern are interpreted as nodes and edges of directed graphs, and the resulting query graph is matched to the data graph using variables as wild cards. Various W3C standards, including RDF 1.2 Concepts and Abstract Syntax and OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Mapping to RDF Graphs (Second Edition), provide semantic interpretations for RDF graphs that allow additional RDF statements to be inferred from explicitly given assertions. Many applications that rely on these semantics require a query language such as SPARQL, but in order to use SPARQL, basic graph pattern matching has to be defined using semantic entailment relations instead of explicitly given graph structures. There are different possible ways of defining a basic graph pattern matching extension for an entailment relation. This document specifies one such way for a range of standard semantic web entailment relations. Such extensions of the SPARQL semantics are called entailment regimes within this document. An entailment regime defines not only which entailment relation is used, but also which queries and graphs are well-formed for the regime, how the entailment is used (since there are potentially different meaningful ways to use the same entailment relation), and what kinds of errors can arise. The entailment relations used in this document are standard entailment relations in the semantic web: RDF entailment, RDFS entailment, D-entailment, OWL Direct and RDF-Based Semantics entailment, and RIF Core entailment.",

For the first time in very common software tools, it is possible to separate content and presentation in data. This old dream of SGML gurus, fighting against the rest of the world to make people realize this is important, is now a reality. Each HTML element can carry presentation styles and forget presentation HTML attributes.The main effect of this evolution is the deprecation of several HTML elements and attributes. It is then necessary to describe the set of transformations that should be applied to a HTML document containing these deprecated items in order to make it conformant to HTML Clean and take advantage of CSS.Furthermore, there is a solution to manipulate the contents of a document as an author may need it, such as automatic building of a table of contents. Very simple content generation operations are possible using W3C selectors in a new way described in this specification.The current specification does not want to re-invent the wheel and it should not be extended to a very large set of operations. The goal of the current specification is only to provide a simple and quick implementation of a transformation algorithm of documents that a HTTP server or a site management tool could for instance handle on the fly .STTS use the core CSS syntax, while extending the CSS selectors. There is no restriction on CSS existing selectors.",

    "description": "XML is a new standard that supports data exchange on the World-Wide Web. It is likely to become as important and as widely used as HTML. The availability of large amounts of data on the Web raises several issues that the XML standard does not address.  In particular, what techniques and tools should exist for extracting data from large XML documents, for translating XML data between different ontologies (DTD\u0027s), for integrating XML data from multiple XML sources, and for transporting large amounts of XML data to clients or for sending queries to XML sources. We propose a query language for XML, called XML-QL, as one possible answer to these questions.  The language has a SELECT-WHERE construct, like SQL, and borrows features of query languages recently developed by the database research community for semistructured data.",

RDF is primarily for describing resources and their relations, while XLink is primarily for specifying and traversing hyperlinks. However, the overlap between the two is sufficient that a mapping from XLink links to statements in an RDF model can be defined. Such a mapping allows XLink elements to be harvested as a source of RDF statements. XLink links (hereafter, \"links\") thus provide an alternate syntax for RDF information that may be useful in some situations. This Note specifies such a mapping, so that links can be harvested and RDF statements generated. The purpose of this harvesting is to create RDF models that, in some sense, represent the \u003cem\u003eintent\u003c/em\u003e of the XML document. The purpose is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e to represent the XLink structure in enough detail that a set of links could be round-tripped through an RDF model.",

The basic claim of this paper is that the logical theory produced by the mapping specified herein of a set of such descriptions is logically equivalent to the intended meaning of that set of descriptions. Providing a means of translating RDF, RDF-S, and DAML+OIL descriptions into a first-order predicate calculus logical theory not only specifies the intended meaning of the descriptions, but also produces a representation of the descriptions from which inferences can automatically be made using traditional automatic theorem provers and problem solvers.  For example, the DAML+OIL axioms enable a reasoner to infer from the two statements \"Class Male and class Female are disjointWith.\" and \"John is type Male.\" that the statement \"John is type Female.\" is false.",

Voice interaction features are integrated directly with XHTML and CSS, and can consequently be used directly within XHTML content.The XHTML+Voice  profile is designed for Web clients that support visual and spoken interaction.  To this end, this document first re-formulates VoiceXML 2.0as a collection of modules.  These modules, along with Speech Synthesis Markup Language and Speech Recognition Grammar Format are then integrated with XHTML using XHTML modularization to create the XHTML+Voice profile.  Finally, we integrate the result with module XML-Events so that voice handlers can be invoked through a standard DOM2 EventListener interface.",

The challenge of crafting a protocol specification is to create a description of behaviour that is not tied to any particular approach to implementation. There is a need to abstract away from some of the messy implementation details of buffer management, data representation and specific APIs. However, in order to describe the behaviour of a protocol one has to establish a set of (useful) concepts that can be used in that description. An abstract model is one way to establish a consistent set of concepts. An abstract model is a tool for the description of complex behaviour — it is not a template for an implementation... although it should not stray so far away from reality that it is impossible to recognise how the required behaviours would be implemented.",

XForms is not a free-standing document type, but is intended to be integrated into other markup languages, such as XHTML\u003cspan\u003e, ODF\u003c/span\u003e or SVG. An XForms-based web form gathers and processes XML data using an architecture that separates presentation, purpose and content. The underlying data of a form is organized into \u003cb\u003einstances\u003c/b\u003e of data schema (though formal schema definitions are not required). An XForm allows processing of data to occur using three mechanisms: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e a declarative \u003cb\u003emodel\u003c/b\u003e composed of formulae for data calculations and constraints, data type and other property declarations, and data submission parameters \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e a \u003cb\u003eview\u003c/b\u003e layer composed of intent-based user interface controls \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e an imperative \u003cb\u003econtroller\u003c/b\u003e for orchestrating data manipulations, interactions between the model and view layers, and data submissions. \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e Thus, XForms accommodates form component reuse, fosters strong data type validation, eliminates unnecessary round-trips to the server, offers device independence and reduces the need for scripting. XForms 1.1 refines the XML processing platform introduced by [XForms 1.0] by adding several new submission capabilities, action handlers, utility functions, user interface improvements, and helpful datatypes as well as a more powerful action processing facility, including conditional, iterated and background execution, the ability to manipulate data arbitrarily and to access event context information.",

This Note suggests an implementation strategy for implementors to adopt to enable users and specifications to get such support in a consistent way. All aspects of XML Schema which are liable to re-interpretation as a result of changes in XML 1.1 are discussed. An implementation of schema-validity assessment employing such a strategy is strictly speaking non-conformant to the current version of the XML Schema specification. The XML Schema WG none-the-less believes that interoperability will best be served by such non-conformant processors being made available to users, until such time as a subsequent version of XML Schema addressing this issue normatively is approved.",

    "description": "Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is an ISO standard, defined by ISO/IEC 8632:1999, for the interchange of 2D vector and mixed vector/raster graphics. WebCGM is a profile of CGM, which adds Web linking and is optimized for Web applications in technical illustration, electronic documentation, geophysical data visualization, and similar fields. First published (1.0) in 1999 and followed by a second (errata) release in 2001, WebCGM unifies potentially diverse approaches to CGM utilization in Web document applications. It therefore represents a significant interoperability agreement amongst major users and implementers of the ISO CGM standard. WebCGM 2.0 adds a DOM (API) specification for programmatic access to WebCGM objects, and a specification of an XML Companion File (XCF) architecture, for externalization of non-graphical metadata. WebCGM 2.0, in addition, builds upon and extends the graphical and intelligent content of WebCGM 1.0, delivering functionality that was forecast for WebCGM 1.0, but was postponed in order to get the standard and its implementations to users expeditiously. The design criteria for WebCGM aim at a balance between graphical expressive power on the one hand, and simplicity and implementability on the other. A small but powerful set of standardized metadata elements supports the functionalities of hyperlinking and document navigation, picture structuring and layering, and enabling search and query of WebCGM picture content.",

Any XML document is part of a set of XML documents that are logically equivalent within an application context, but which vary in physical representation based on syntactic changes permitted by XML 1.0 [XML] and Namespaces in XML 1.0 [Names]. This specification describes a method for generating a physical representation, the canonical form, of an XML document that accounts for the permissible changes. Except for limitations regarding a few unusual cases, if two documents have the same canonical form, then the two documents are logically equivalent within the given application context. Note that two documents may have differing canonical forms yet still be equivalent in a given context based on application-specific equivalence rules for which no generalized XML specification could account. Canonical XML Version 1.1 is applicable to XML 1.0 and defined in terms of the XPath 1.0 data model. It is not defined for XML 1.1.",

It elaborates upon the group\u0027s Charter [WSC-CHARTER] to explain what the group aims to achieve, what technologies may be used and how technical proposals will be evaluated. This elaboration is limited to the group\u0027s technical work and does not cover additional activities the group intends to engage in, such as ongoing outreach and education. This Note also includes an initial collection of use cases that the group expects will drive its technical work. Since this Note discusses the assumptions, goals, and processes the group will use to develop its recommendations, the intended audience is similiar to that of the charter of the Working Group; group members, the W3C community, developers of web user agents, web content providers (server administrators), and parties interested and engaged in what the Web Security Context Working Group\u0027s plans and directions are. It is explicitly not targeted at the presumed beneficiaries of the group\u0027s work, the users of the web, and it is not expected that an average user would be able to read this document and understand it.",

It introduces both the basic and advanced concepts of XBL and describes its syntax and scenarios that should be considered best-practice. It also describes the purpose of the language elements described in the XBL 2.0 specification. XBL describes the ability to associate elements in one document with script, event handlers, styles, and more complex content models in another document. You can use XBL to re-order and wrap content so that, for instance, simple HTML or XHTML markup can have complex CSS styles applied without requiring that the markup be polluted with multiple \u003ccode\u003ediv\u003c/code\u003e elements. In addition, if you are a programmer, you can use XBL to implement new DOM interfaces, and, in conjunction with other specifications, it enables arbitrary XML tag sets to be treated as \"widgets\" (pluggable user interface components).",

When publishers can express this data more completely, and when tools can read it, a new world of user functionality becomes available, letting users transfer structured data between applications and web sites. An event on a web page can be directly imported into a user\u0027s desktop calendar. A license on a document can be detected so that the user is informed of his rights automatically. A photo\u0027s creator, camera setting information, resolution, and topic can be published as easily as the original photo itself, enabling structured search and sharing. RDFa is a syntax for expressing RDF structured data in HTML. This document provides use case scenarios for RDFa.

The PEP mechanism is designed to associate each extension with a URI, and use a few new RFC 822 derived header fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties involved in an extended transaction.This document defines PEP and describes the interactions between PEP and HTTP/1.1. PEP is intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 inasmuch as HTTP/1.1 is compatible with HTTP/1.0. It is proposed that the PEP extension mechanism be included in future versions of HTTP.The PEP extension mechanism may be applicable to other information exchange not mentioned in this document. It is recommended that readers get acquainted with section 1.4 for a suggested reading of this specification and a list of sections specific for HTTP based applications.",

For this reason, multiple vendors have proposed C callable APIs. These APIs allow authors to alleviate the performance penalty of CGI, and allow tighter integration of add-in modules. Unfortunately, this comes at the price of complexity and portability. This document describes a new model for extending WWW servers. First, HTTP is captured using an interface specification, which eliminates the ambiguities of interpretating a standards-track document. This interface is then implemented atop a particular httpd\u0027s API. Finally, all of this is done using a standard distributed object model called ILU. Digital Creations\u0027 work on our ILU Requester reflects this design and shows its advantages. This paper describes the ILU Requester.",

Nevertheless, both legal and ethical frameworks play an important role in shaping what can be considered “responsible”. As do the perspectives of those who interact closely with spatial data: the developers, the users and the regulators. Therefore this note not only provides an insight into the relevant legislation and ethics guidelines, but also considers the principles of ethical data sharing from each of these three perspectives. The principles are made practical by providing concrete communication guidelines and showing examples of good practice.",
